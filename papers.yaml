      We report the performance assessment of the 91 methods that were submitted 
      to the SAMPL6 blind challenge for predicting octanol-water partition coefficient 
      (logP) measurements. The average RMSE of the most accurate five MM-based, QM-based, 
      empirical, and mixed approach methods based on RMSE were 0.92±0.13, 0.48±0.06, 0.47±0.05, 
      and 0.50±0.06, respectively.

    description: >
      To assess the relative efficiencies of alchemical binding free energy calculations, 
      the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge asked participants to submit predictions as a function of 
      computer effort for the same force field and charge model. Surprisingly, we found that 
      most molecular simulation codes cannot agree on the binding free energy was, even for 
      the same force field.

      We describe the design and data collection (and associated challenges) for the SAMPL6      
      part II logP octanol-water blind prediction challenge, where the goal was to benchmark the 
      accuracy of force fields for druglike molecules (here, molecules 
      resembling kinase inhibitors).

    description: >
       Graph convolutional and message-passing networks can be a powerful tool for predicting physical properties of 
       small molecules when coupled to a simple physical model that encodes the relevant invariances. Here, we show 
       the ability of graph nets to predict partial atomic charges for use in molecular dynamics simulations and
       physical docking.

       To understand how kinase regulation by phosphorylation emerged, we reconstruct the common ancestor of CDKs and
       MAPKs, using biochemical experiments and massively parallel molecular simulations to study how a few mutations 
       were sufficient to switch ERK-family kinases from high- to low-autophosphorylation.

    # Two newlines are needed after the description
    description: >
      In this work, we show how targeted X-ray crystallography using covalent inhibitors and depletion of 
      native ligands to reveal structures of low-population hidden conformations can be combined with 
      massively distributed molecular simulation to resolve the functional dynamic landscape of the protein 
      methyltransferase SETD8 in unprecedented atomistic detail. Using an aggregate of six milliseconds of 
      fully atomistic simulation from Folding@home, we use Markov state models to illuminate the 
      conformational dynamics of this important epigenetic protein.
      
      All Folding@home simulation trajectories for this paper are available on the Open Science Framework.
      
      The trajectories generated for this project were used as the source for a unique musical composition 'Metastable' 
      by George Holloway, performed by the Ligeti String Quartet with visual accompaniment from Robert Arbon.

      A class of kinases are particularly promiscuous binders of small molecule inhibitors. Using combined

      major members of this class, is likely due to an unusually stable DFG-out conformation.

      We present an overview of the host-guest systems and participant performance for the 
      SAMPL6 host-guest blind affinity prediction challenges, assessing how well various 
      physical modeling approaches were able to predict ligand binding affinities for simple 
      ligand recognition problems where receptor sampling and protonation state effects are 
      eliminated due to the simplicity of supramolecular hosts. We find that progress is 
      now stagnated likely due to force field limitations.

      Human kinase catalytic domains---the therapeutic target of selective kinase inhibitors 
      used in the treatment of cancer and other diseases---are notoriously difficult and expensive 
      to express in insect or human cells. Here, we utilize the phosphatase co-expression technology 
      developed by Markus Seeliger (now at Stony Brook) to develop a library of human kinase 
      catalytic domains for facile and inexpensive expression in bacteria.

     The SAMPL5 blind challenge exercises identified neglect of protonation state effects as 
     a major accuracy-limiting factor in physical modeling of biomolecular interactions. In 
     this study, we report the experimental measurements behind a SAMPL6 blind challenges in 
     which we assess the ability of community codes to predict small molecule pKas for small 
     molecule resembling fragments of selective kinase inhibitors.

     Molecular dynamics simulations necessarily use a finite timestep, which introduces error 
     or bias in the sampled configuration space density that grows rapidly with increasing timestep. 
     For the first time, we show how to compute a natural measure of this error---the KL 
     divergence---in both phase and configuration space for a widely used family of Langevin 
     integrators, and show that VRORV is generally superior for simulation of molecular systems.

     Solicited manuscript for special issue of the Journal of Computer Aided Molecular Design on 
     the SAMPL5 Challenge.
     The SAMPL Challenges have driven predictive physical modeling for ligand:protein binding 
     forward by focusing the community on a series of blind challenges that evaluate performance 
     on blind datasets, focus attention on current challenges for physical modeling techniques, 
     and provide high-quality experimental datasets to the community after the challenge is over. 
     For many years, challenges focused around hydration free energies have proven to be extremely 
     useful, with theory now able to determine when experiment is wrong. To replace these challenges, 
     since no more hydration free energy data is being measured, we proposed to use the partition or 
     distribution coefficients of small druglike molecules between aqueous and apolar phases. We
     report the collection of cyclohexane-water partition data for a set of compounds used to 
     drive the SAMPL5 distribution coefficient challenge, providing the experimental data, 
     methodology, and insight for future iterations of this challenge.

    description: >
     The drug development community faced a puzzling challenge when a disturbing paper published in PLoS 
     One demonstrated results from the same assay performed with different dispensing technologies both 
     varied wildly and significantly different in magnitude of reported potencies. Inspired by a talk 
     given at the 2014 CADD GRC by Cosma Shalizi on bootstrapping to model error, we show how this 
     simple idea can help explain a large amount of the discrepancy in this assay, and provide 
     simple mathematical tools and an IPython notebook illustrating how easy it is to model the 
     error and bias in experimental assays even when other information about assay reliability 
     is unavailable.

     Progress in forcefield validation and parameterization has been hindered by the availability 
     of high-quality machine-readable physical property data for small organic molecules. We show 
     how the NIST ThermoML dataset provides a solution to this problem, and demonstrate its utility 
     in benchmarking the GAFF/AM1-BCC small molecule forcefield on neat liquid densities and static 
     dielectric constants to uncover problems in the representation of low-dielectric environments.

     Machine learning encompasses a set of tools and algorithms which are now becoming popular in almost 
     all scientific and technological fields. This is true for molecular dynamics as well, where machine 
     learning offers promises of extracting valuable information from the enormous amounts of data 
     generated by simulation of complex systems. We provide here a review of our current understanding 
     of goals, benefits, and limitations of machine learning techniques for computational studies on 
     atomistic systems, focusing on the construction of empirical force fields from ab-initio 
     databases and the determination of reaction coordinates for free energy computation and enhanced 
     sampling.

     The pK a is the standard measure used to describe the aqueous proton affinity of a compound, indicating
     the proton concentration (pH) at which two protonation states (eg A− and AH) have equal free energy. 
     However, compounds can have additional protonation states (eg AH 2+), and may assume multiple 
     tautomeric forms, with the protons in different positions (microstates). Macroscopic pK a s give the 
     pH where the molecule changes its total number of protons, while microscopic pK a s identify the 
     tautomeric states involved. As tautomers have the same number of protons, the free energy difference 
     between them and their relative probability is pH independent so there is no pK a connecting them. 
     The question arises: What is the best way to describe protonation equilibria of a complex molecule in 
     any pH range? Knowing the number of protons and the relative free energy of all microstates at a 
     single pH,∆ G …

    description: >
     Designing ligands that bind their target biomolecules with high affinity and specificity is a key step 
     in small-molecule drug discovery, but accurately predicting protein–ligand binding free energies 
     remains challenging. Key sources of errors in the calculations include inadequate sampling of 
     conformational space, ambiguous protonation states, and errors in force fields. Noncovalent 
     complexes between a host molecule with a binding cavity and a druglike guest molecule have emerged 
     as powerful model systems. As model systems, host–guest complexes reduce many of the errors in more 
     complex protein–ligand binding systems, as their small size greatly facilitates conformational 
     sampling, and one can choose systems that avoid ambiguities in protonation states. These features, 
     combined with their ease of experimental characterization, make host–guest systems ideal model 
     systems to test and ultimately optimize …
