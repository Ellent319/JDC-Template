      We report the performance assessment of the 91 methods that were submitted 
      to the SAMPL6 blind challenge for predicting octanol-water partition coefficient 
      (logP) measurements. The average RMSE of the most accurate five MM-based, QM-based, 
      empirical, and mixed approach methods based on RMSE were 0.92±0.13, 0.48±0.06, 0.47±0.05, 
      and 0.50±0.06, respectively.

    description: >
      To assess the relative efficiencies of alchemical binding free energy calculations, 
      the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge asked participants to submit predictions as a function of 
      computer effort for the same force field and charge model. Surprisingly, we found that 
      most molecular simulation codes cannot agree on the binding free energy was, even for 
      the same force field.

      We describe the design and data collection (and associated challenges) for the SAMPL6      
      part II logP octanol-water blind prediction challenge, where the goal was to benchmark the 
      accuracy of force fields for druglike molecules (here, molecules 
      resembling kinase inhibitors).

       We report the discovery and characterization of a small molecule, AGX51, with the
       surprising ability to inhibit the interaction of Id1 with E47, which leads to ubiquitin-mediated
       degradation of Ids.

    description: >
    Graph convolutional and message-passing networks can be a powerful tool for predicting physical properties of 
    small molecules when coupled to a simple physical model that encodes the relevant invariances. Here, we show 
    the ability of graph nets to predict partial atomic charges for use in molecular dynamics simulations and
    physical docking.

       There is a dire need to establish standards for sharing data in the molecular sciences. Here, we 
       review the findings of a workshop held in Stockholm in Nov 2018 to discuss this need.
