      We report the performance assessment of the 91 methods that were submitted 
      to the SAMPL6 blind challenge for predicting octanol-water partition coefficient 
      (logP) measurements. The average RMSE of the most accurate five MM-based, QM-based, 
      empirical, and mixed approach methods based on RMSE were 0.92±0.13, 0.48±0.06, 0.47±0.05, 
      and 0.50±0.06, respectively.

    description: >
      To assess the relative efficiencies of alchemical binding free energy calculations, 
      the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge asked participants to submit predictions as a function of 
      computer effort for the same force field and charge model. Surprisingly, we found that 
      most molecular simulation codes cannot agree on the binding free energy was, even for 
      the same force field.

      We describe the design and data collection (and associated challenges) for the SAMPL6      
      part II logP octanol-water blind prediction challenge, where the goal was to benchmark the 
      accuracy of force fields for druglike molecules (here, molecules 
      resembling kinase inhibitors).

    description: >
       Graph convolutional and message-passing networks can be a powerful tool for predicting physical properties of 
       small molecules when coupled to a simple physical model that encodes the relevant invariances. Here, we show 
       the ability of graph nets to predict partial atomic charges for use in molecular dynamics simulations and
       physical docking.

       To understand how kinase regulation by phosphorylation emerged, we reconstruct the common ancestor of CDKs and
       MAPKs, using biochemical experiments and massively parallel molecular simulations to study how a few mutations 
       were sufficient to switch ERK-family kinases from high- to low-autophosphorylation.

    # Two newlines are needed after the description
    description: >
      In this work, we show how targeted X-ray crystallography using covalent inhibitors and depletion of 
      native ligands to reveal structures of low-population hidden conformations can be combined with 
      massively distributed molecular simulation to resolve the functional dynamic landscape of the protein 
      methyltransferase SETD8 in unprecedented atomistic detail. Using an aggregate of six milliseconds of 
      fully atomistic simulation from Folding@home, we use Markov state models to illuminate the 
      conformational dynamics of this important epigenetic protein.
      
      All Folding@home simulation trajectories for this paper are available on the Open Science Framework.
      
      The trajectories generated for this project were used as the source for a unique musical composition 'Metastable' 
      by George Holloway, performed by the Ligeti String Quartet with visual accompaniment from Robert Arbon.

      A class of kinases are particularly promiscuous binders of small molecule inhibitors. Using combined

      major members of this class, is likely due to an unusually stable DFG-out conformation.

      We present an overview of the host-guest systems and participant performance for the 
      SAMPL6 host-guest blind affinity prediction challenges, assessing how well various 
      physical modeling approaches were able to predict ligand binding affinities for simple 
      ligand recognition problems where receptor sampling and protonation state effects are 
      eliminated due to the simplicity of supramolecular hosts. We find that progress is 
      now stagnated likely due to force field limitations.

      Human kinase catalytic domains---the therapeutic target of selective kinase inhibitors 
      used in the treatment of cancer and other diseases---are notoriously difficult and expensive 
      to express in insect or human cells. Here, we utilize the phosphatase co-expression technology 
      developed by Markus Seeliger (now at Stony Brook) to develop a library of human kinase 
      catalytic domains for facile and inexpensive expression in bacteria.

     The SAMPL5 blind challenge exercises identified neglect of protonation state effects as 
     a major accuracy-limiting factor in physical modeling of biomolecular interactions. In 
     this study, we report the experimental measurements behind a SAMPL6 blind challenges in 
     which we assess the ability of community codes to predict small molecule pKas for small 
     molecule resembling fragments of selective kinase inhibitors.

     We show how Bayesian inference can produce greatly improved estimates of statistical uncertainty 
     from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments, allowing the joint distribution of 
     thermodynamic parameter uncertainties to be inferred.
